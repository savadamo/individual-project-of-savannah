Abstract of My Project: 
By combining data analysis techniques and tools with humantist approaches, this research aims to uncover more information on our species' relation to the sea through ship voyage. This project specifically used data analysis to investigate shipwrecks around the world. The research was based upon a data set, titled "ENC Wrecks", uploaded for the public by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Congress. The data in the set provided meta data on over 11,000 shipwrecks, such as information of the individual ships' depth, visibility, longitude and latitude placement, and other defining characteristics. Python programming in Jupyter Notebook was used to further explore this data in an effort to discover conclusions in regard to commonalities amongst shipwreckages. By tools from the programming which allowed for both graphs, such as a histogram and scatter plot, and a frequency word counter, it could be concluded that shipwreckages were, in fact, occuring in centralized places and that the vast majority of these wrecks were submerged underwater. These findings are signficant overall because they are not only of value on their own standing, but they also can also possibly be used by other researchers in Marine Archaelogy for future projects, ship engineers, and ocean navigators to expand upon our greater understanding of the ocean and our human relationship with it.
