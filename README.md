Abstract of My Project: 
(Intro sentence on why dh is important in this research and why this research is important). This project used data analysis to investigate shipwrecks around the world. The research was based upon a data set, titled "ENC Wrecks", uploaded for the public by the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration in the U.S. Department of Congress. The data in the set provided meta data on over 11,000 shipwrecks, such as information of the individual ships' depth, visibility, longitude and latitude placement, and other defining characteristics. Python programming in Jupyter Notebook was used to further explore this data in an effort to discover conclusions in regard to commonalities amongst shipwreckages. By tools from the programming which allowed for both graphs, such as a histogram and scatter plot, and a frequency word counter, it could be concluded that shipwreckages were, in fact, occuring in centralized places and that the vast majority of these wrecks were submerged underwater. (Why is this signficant overall sentence here to finish it up)
